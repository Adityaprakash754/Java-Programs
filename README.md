# Java-Programs
Implementations of Core Java Concepts 

Folder Contents:
1. - use of getter and setter basic program.
2. - Multithreading Concept with random number creation and it's square and cube.
3. - Facade Design Pattern.
4. - Exception Handeling
      - demo - Divide with zero error till user inserts a non zero value
      - Prog1 - exception with multiple catch block
      - Prog2 - Divide with zero error
      - Prog3 - Divide with zero error with use of finally block
      - Prog4 - class not found exception
5. - Multithreading Concept to print n numbers while the thread sleeps for 1 sec.
6. - Write a program to perform string operations using ArrayList. Write functions for
the following a. Append - add at end b. Insert â€“ add at particular index c. Search d. List all
string starts with given letter.
   - Prog - Same above program in simpler way and with for each loop.
7. - ArrayList
      - Prog1 - implement loose Coupling on arrayList of Student
      - Prog2 - Write a program to create employee object ,arrayList class , make use of generics and for printing objets use iterator 
      - other - Basic ArrayList Operations

       - DemoArrays - implementations of arrays
       - DemoString - implementations of constant and non constant pool of strings
       - DemoStringOpr - builtin string operations
       - DemoStrPallindrome - Pallindrome of strings
       - prac - some tricky programs
14. - File Operation
15. - Priority Queue
       - PriQBasic - Basic Priority Queue Operation
       - PriQEmp - implementing Priority Queue and Sorting it based on Eid.
16. - Sorting using Comparable and Comprator interface 
       - Prog1 - Using java collections implement comparator and comparable interface to sort an arrayList of type Laptop 
       - Prog2 - Using java collections implement comparator and comparable interface to sort an arrayList of type Employee
